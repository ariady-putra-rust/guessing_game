/* Borrowing Rules */
// 1. At any given time, you can have _either_ (but not both) one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
// 2. References must always be valid.

// The opposite of referencing by using `&` is dereferencing,
// which is accomplished with the dereference operator `*`
pub fn borrowing() {
    // let s = String::from("hello");
    // change(&s); // expected &mut String, found &String
    //             // mismatched types
    //             // expected mutable reference `&mut String`
    //             //            found reference `&String`
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    change(&mut s);

    println!("{s}");

    /* Mutable references have one big restriction:
    if you have a mutable reference to a value,
    you can have no other references to that value.
    This code that attempts to create two mutable references to `s` will fail:
    */
    // let mut s = String::from("hello");
    // let r1 = &mut s;
    // let r2 = &mut s; // cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time
    // println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);

    /* Rust enforces a similar rule for combining mutable and immutable references.
    This code results in an error:
    */
    // let mut s = String::from("hello");
    // let r1 = &s;
    // let r2 = &s;
    // let r3 = &mut s; // cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
    // println!("{}, {}, and {}", r1, r2, r3);
    /*
    but this code will compile because the last usage of the immutable references,
    the `println!`, occurs before the mutable reference is introduced:
    */
    // let mut s = String::from("hello");
    // let r1 = &s;
    // let r2 = &s;
    // println!("{r1}, {r2}"); // variables r1 and r2 will not be used after this point
    // let r3 = &mut s;
    // println!("{r3}");
    /*
    This code will also result in an error:
    */

    // let r2 = &s; // cannot borrow `s` as immutable because it is also borrowed as mutable

    multiple immutable references are allowed because no one who is just reading the data has the ability to affect anyone else's reading of the data
